# First-App

I made this first iOS app as practice on using xcode and swift. I learned a great deal in this project about how iOS
development is generally done. Following a tutorial on youtube, I created a small game where you draw two cards between a 
player and a computer and whoever has the higher card value gets a win. 

The most important thing I learned while doing this project was connecting the storyboard with the code. Creating outlets and
actions are much easier than I thought they would be and relatively easy to manipulate. The storyboard itself I had a little 
more trouble with because I could not always get the constraints I wanted and could not format a text field properly either. 

The original project only contained the deal button with the cards and score labels changing, but I added extra features for 
practice. 

- I implemented a small delay so that the cards would go back to being hidden after they are revealed. 
  *it originally just changed the cards when you clicked deal 
  
- added a win rate at the bottom to practice stack views and labels as well as basic swift syntax for doing calculations as 
  such.
